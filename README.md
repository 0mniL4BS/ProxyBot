I coded this bot for zProxyz
This bot contains many parts and have a few things to run for the full experience. I will be simplying the code in the future, as Discord.js 12 is still in beta,
and can only code this as fast as they update the repo.

Main Bot Commands:
*Mute
*unmute
*kick
*ban
*help
*report
*meme
*whois

Music Commands:
*play
*stop
*skip
*pause
*resume
*volume

Other features such as Mod-Log and Anti-Spam dont have commands to enable or disable them, as long as you run the process then it will be enabled.

Run the following processes below to get the bot fully online.
Main File path (bot):
*node bot.js
*node modlog.ls
